# Project:Portfolio

# Portfolio 
 Portfolio was created to include all credentials and work that was created in order to have a proper display of all credentials for future reference. Portfolio is fully functional with corresponding links with learned knowledge of html and CSS to be able to create a fully operational portfolio. Challenges mostly stemmed from first time experience in learning to properly utilize html and CSS properly in creating the portfolio. There was various trial and error in being able to layout the images accordinly and having the correct distance from one another. You learn more from trial and error in this case and using it as fuel to be able to go back and touch up on certain sections of CSS. Creating and utilizing a flex box and display cards were very challenging but with persistance it was able to be created to fit the portfolio page. This project stands on its own due to being a first time creationt that was able to utilize all the necessary criteria in order to be fully functional.
